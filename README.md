# Web@cad√©mie 2020

Here are the different projects I had to make for school. We had 1 week to make all of these.

## Projects

### Framework_Bootstrap

We had to create a Bootstrap clone using SASS to learn it. 

You can actually see a demo from [here](https://yunseok.github.io/projects/web/Framework_Bootstrap)

### matchstick

This project was used to work with algorithm and it is the matchstick game in Python, to use it: 


```bash
python matchstick.py <number of lines> <number of max sticks to put out>
```

### WacTorrent

Group project (with useless classmates as usual), we had to create a torrent client using Python. This project was used to learn Python.

Be sure to put torrents file in the /torrents folder

```bash
python ./wacTorrent_CLI.py
```

The program will create a folder called /downloads and download the torrents in that folder

### Battleship

Another project to learn more about algorithm in programming languages this time, it's PHP.

### prime_numbers

Early school project. It's about knowing if a number is a prime number. Made in PHP. 

### my_paint

Creating a Paint clone application with jQuery

### Maquette_Introduction

I had to create a HTML, CSS website based from a picture. 

### Maquette_Responsive

Same as Maquette_Introduction but with a working Carousel in CSS and it had to be responsive

### Drive_Wac

Google Drive clone using PHP and stuff 

### Previously_On

MyAnimeList but with TV shows & movies 

run it with npm run start (be sure to do a npm install first)

## Meta

There are a lot more projects but I mostly lost them, we mostly worked with PHP, SQL, HTML, CSS and different frameworks such as Laravel, Symfony, jQuery, Bootstrap, etc...
